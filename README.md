# shopify_websites
This repository gives you the shopify websites I built.

1) www.evadesign.us - I built this website from scratch. I used the theme called Impulse. Then I added adjusted the website according to the requirements document. After I completed the website, we had a few revisions with the client to make sure I deliver the best product.
