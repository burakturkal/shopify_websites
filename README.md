# shopify_websites
This repository gives you the shopify websites I built.

1) www.evadesign.com - I built this website from scratch. I used the theme called Impulse. Then I added adjusted the website according to the requirements document. After I completed the website, we had a few revisions with the client to make sure I deliver the best product. The client asked for an ecommerce website in which they can sell worldwide. I offered them to build it either Wordpress or Shopify. I explained them Shopify would be better for them for cheaper startup cost and easier maintainance.
